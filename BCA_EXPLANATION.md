## Core Mathematical Concepts

### 1. Power vs Energy Relationship
```python
Energy [MWh] = Power [MW] × Time [hours]
settlement_period = 15 minutes = 0.25 hours  # Common grid settlement period
```

### 2. Efficiency Modeling
```python
# Round-trip efficiency split symmetrically
efficiency = RTE^0.5
# If RTE = 85%, then charge_eff = discharge_eff = √0.85 ≈ 92.2%
```

### 3. Capacity Relationships
```python
Storage_Capacity [MWh] = Power_Rating [MW] × Duration [hours]
# e.g., 10 MW × 4 hours = 40 MWh capacity
```

---

## Power Flow Mathematics

### Available Power Calculation
```python
# Method varies by case type
if case_type == 1:  # Hybrid (Wind + Solar)
    Available_Power = Wind_Generation + (Solar_Scale_Factor × Solar_Generation)
else:  # Wind only
    Available_Power = Wind_Generation
```

### Transmission Constraint
```python
# Physical limit of what can be exported to grid
Exported_Power = min(Available_Power, Available_Transmission_Capacity)
```

### Delta Power - The Core Constraint
```python
deltapower = Available_Transmission_Capacity - Available_Power

# Interpretation:
# deltapower < 0: Overproduction (curtailment occurs)
# deltapower = 0: Perfect match
# deltapower > 0: Underproduction (could discharge storage)
```

**Mathematical Significance**: This single variable determines the entire storage strategy. It represents the **mismatch** between what you can generate and what you can export.

## Storage Operations Logic

### Charging Decision Tree

```python
theor_charging = np.where(
    deltapower < 0,                    # Condition 1: Overproduction
    -deltapower,                       # Action: Store excess renewable energy
    np.where(
        Balancing_Prices < 0,          # Condition 2: Negative prices
        power_level,                   # Action: Charge at full power (get paid to consume)
        0                              # Action: Don't charge
    )
)
```

**Logic Breakdown**:
1. **Primary**: If renewable generation exceeds transmission → store the excess
2. **Secondary**: If grid has negative prices → get paid to charge
3. **Default**: Don't charge

### Discharging Decision Tree

```python
# Maximum possible discharge (respecting transmission limits)
max_discharging = np.where(
    deltapower < 0,                    # During overproduction
    0,                                 # Cannot discharge (no transmission capacity)
    -min(power_level, deltapower/efficiency)  # Limited by power rating or transmission
)

# Actual discharge decision
theor_discharging = np.where(
    deltapower < 0,                    # During overproduction
    0,                                 # Cannot discharge
    np.where(
        Balancing_Prices > 1.3 * Wholesale_Price,  # Premium pricing
        max_discharging,               # Discharge at maximum rate
        0                              # Don't discharge
    )
)
```

**Key Insight**: The 1.3 multiplier creates a **profit margin requirement** - only discharge when balancing prices are 30% above wholesale, ensuring profitable arbitrage after accounting for losses and risks.

## Revenue Stream Calculations

### 1. Baseline Revenue (No Storage)
```python
baseline_income = (Wholesale_Price + Green_Certificate) × Exported_Power × settlement_period
```

### 2. Balancing Market Integration
```python
# Split energy sales between markets
wholesale_portion = Exported_Power × (1 - balancing_percentage)
balancing_portion = Exported_Power × balancing_percentage

bal_income = (
    (Wholesale_Price + Green_Certificate) × wholesale_portion × settlement_period +
    (Balancing_Prices + Green_Certificate) × balancing_portion × settlement_period
)
```

### 3. Storage Revenue Logic - The Complex Part

This is where the model gets sophisticated. The revenue calculation considers **six different operational scenarios**:

```python
storage_income = np.where(
    eff_charge_discharge == 0,         # [A] IDLE
    bal_income,                        # Standard balancing market income
    
    np.where(
        eff_charge_discharge < 0,      # [B] DISCHARGING
        bal_income - eff_charge_discharge × Balancing_Prices × settlement_period,
        # Revenue = baseline + discharge_energy × price_premium
        
        np.where(
            deltapower < 0,            # [C] CHARGING during overproduction
            bal_income,                # Full balancing market income (storing free energy)
            
            np.where(
                power_level <= bal_power,  # [D] Storage smaller than balancing allocation
                bal_income - eff_charge_discharge × Balancing_Prices × settlement_period,
                
                np.where(
                    power_level <= Exported_Power,  # [E] Storage smaller than export
                    bal_income - bal_power × Balancing_Prices × settlement_period - 
                    (eff_charge_discharge - bal_power) × (Wholesale_Price + Balancing_Prices) × settlement_period,
                    
                    # [F] Storage larger than export (drawing from grid)
                    (bal_power - power_level) × Balancing_Prices × settlement_period
                )
            )
        )
    )
)
```

**Scenario Breakdown**:
- **[A] IDLE**: Normal operation, no storage activity
- **[B] DISCHARGING**: Selling stored energy at premium prices
- **[C] OVERPRODUCTION CHARGING**: Storing curtailed renewable energy
- **[D] SMALL STORAGE**: All charging from balancing market allocation
- **[E] MEDIUM STORAGE**: Mixed charging from balancing + wholesale markets
- **[F] LARGE STORAGE**: Drawing additional power from grid

## Financial Modeling

### Cash Flow Structure
```python
# Initial investment
Storage_CAPEX = 1000 × (Unit_CAPEX_kW × power_level + Unit_CAPEX_kWh × capacity)

# Annual operating costs
Storage_OPEX = Storage_CAPEX × OPEX_rate

# Annual storage benefit
annual_storage_benefit = (total_storage_income - baseline_income) / years_covered

# Project cash flows
cash_flows = [-Storage_CAPEX] + [(annual_storage_benefit - Storage_OPEX)] × Project_Life
```

### NPV Calculation (Excel-style)
```python
# Discounting starts from Year 1 (Excel convention)
NPV = cash_flows[0] + sum(cf / (1 + discount_rate)^i for i, cf in enumerate(cash_flows[1:], start=1))
```

### IRR Calculation
```python
# Find rate where NPV = 0
IRR = rate where sum(cf / (1 + rate)^i) = 0
```

---

## Market Integration

### Price Type Mapping
```python
if price_type.upper() == "IMB":
    Balancing_Prices = Imbalance_Prices
elif price_type.upper() == "INTRA":
    Balancing_Prices = Intra_Day_Prices
else:
    Balancing_Prices = Balancing_Prices  # Default
```

### Market Participation Strategy
```python
# Allocate portion of generation to balancing market
bal_power = balancing_percentage × Exported_Power

# Revenue optimization across markets
total_revenue = wholesale_revenue + balancing_revenue + storage_premium
```

---

## Efficiency and Loss Modeling

### Symmetric Efficiency Model
```python
# Charging losses
energy_into_storage = grid_energy × efficiency

# Discharging losses  
grid_energy = storage_energy × efficiency

# Combined round-trip efficiency
round_trip_efficiency = efficiency²
```

### Loss Calculation in Revenue
```python
# Account for conversion losses in revenue calculations
eff_charge_discharge = np.where(
    charge_discharge >= 0,     # Charging
    charge_discharge / efficiency,    # Energy from grid perspective
    charge_discharge × efficiency     # Energy to grid perspective
)
```

---

## Curtailment Analysis

### Curtailment Without Storage
```python
curtailment_no_storage = max(0, Available_Power - Available_Transmission_Capacity)
```

### Curtailment With Storage
```python
Curtailed_Power = np.where(
    Available_Power > Exported_Power,                    # Overproduction condition
    np.where(
        eff_charge_discharge > 0,                        # Storage is charging
        Available_Power - (Exported_Power + eff_charge_discharge),  # Reduced curtailment
        Available_Power - Exported_Power                 # No storage charging
    ),
    0                                                    # No overproduction
)
```

**Key Metric**: Storage reduces curtailment by storing excess renewable energy that would otherwise be wasted.

---

## State of Charge Dynamics

### SOC Evolution
```python
soc_values = [0]  # Start empty

for i in range(len(df)):
    # Calculate next SOC with physical constraints
    soc_val = np.clip(
        soc_values[-1] + charge_discharge[i] × settlement_period,
        a_min=0,           # Cannot discharge below empty
        a_max=capacity     # Cannot charge above full
    )
    soc_values.append(soc_val)
```

### Actual vs Theoretical Operations
```python
# What storage wants to do
theoretical_operation = max_charge_or_discharge

# What storage actually does (considering SOC limits)
actual_operation = (SOC[t+1] - SOC[t]) / settlement_period
```

**Critical Insight**: The SOC constraints often prevent storage from achieving theoretical optimal operations, which is why the model iteratively calculates actual operations.

## Complete Revenue Logic Breakdown

### Revenue Attribution Logic

The complex storage income calculation addresses the fundamental question: **"How do we fairly attribute revenue when storage changes the power output profile?"**

#### Scenario A: IDLE Operation
```python
if eff_charge_discharge == 0:
    revenue = bal_income  # Standard balancing market revenue
```
**Logic**: No storage activity, so revenue is unchanged from balancing market participation.

#### Scenario B: DISCHARGING
```python
if eff_charge_discharge < 0:  # Negative = discharging
    revenue = bal_income - eff_charge_discharge × Balancing_Prices × settlement_period
```
**Logic**: 
- Base revenue from normal operations
- **Plus** additional revenue from selling stored energy
- `eff_charge_discharge` is negative, so `-(negative × price)` = positive revenue

#### Scenario C: CHARGING During Overproduction
```python
if deltapower < 0:  # Overproduction
    revenue = bal_income
```
**Logic**: When storing curtailed renewable energy, you don't lose any revenue because that energy would have been wasted anyway.

#### Scenarios D, E, F: Various Charging Configurations
These handle the complex interactions between:
- Storage power rating
- Balancing market allocation
- Grid power draw
- Revenue attribution across different power sources

## NPV and IRR Calculations

### Cash Flow Logic
```python
# Year 0: Investment
initial_investment = -Storage_CAPEX

# Years 1-N: Operations
annual_cash_flow = annual_storage_benefit - Storage_OPEX

# Complete cash flow profile
cash_flows = [initial_investment] + [annual_cash_flow] × Project_Life
```

### Storage Benefit Calculation
```python
# Total revenue with storage
total_storage_revenue = storage_income.sum() + extra_generation_income.sum()

# Baseline revenue without storage
baseline_revenue = baseline_income.sum()

# Net benefit attributable to storage
annual_storage_benefit = (total_storage_revenue - baseline_revenue) / years_covered
```

**Key Principle**: Only the **incremental** benefit from storage is considered in the financial analysis, not the total project revenue.

## Edge Cases and Constraints

### Physical Constraints
1. **SOC Limits**: 0% ≤ SOC ≤ 100%
2. **Power Limits**: |charge/discharge| ≤ power_rating
3. **Transmission Limits**: exported_power ≤ transmission_capacity

### Market Constraints
1. **Price Spreads**: Must be sufficient to cover round-trip losses
2. **Balancing Allocation**: Cannot exceed committed balancing market participation
3. **Operational Constraints**: Cannot charge and discharge simultaneously

### Financial Constraints
1. **Positive IRR**: Project must be profitable
2. **Acceptable Payback**: NPV must be positive at required discount rate

## Real-World Applications

### Why This Model Matters

1. **Grid Integration**: Renewable energy creates grid stability challenges that storage can solve profitably
2. **Market Evolution**: Electricity markets increasingly value flexibility and grid services
3. **Economic Optimization**: Multiple revenue streams make storage projects financially viable
4. **Policy Support**: Green certificates and grid service payments support renewable + storage projects

### Key Success Factors

1. **High Curtailment**: Storage is most valuable where renewable generation exceeds transmission capacity
2. **Price Volatility**: Greater price spreads create more arbitrage opportunities  
3. **Market Access**: Ability to participate in multiple markets increases revenue potential
4. **Operational Flexibility**: Smart dispatch strategies maximize value across all revenue streams

### Model Limitations

1. **Perfect Foresight**: Model assumes perfect knowledge of future prices
2. **Static Parameters**: Real-world battery degradation not fully modeled
3. **Market Simplification**: Real electricity markets have additional complexity
4. **Regulatory Risk**: Policy changes can affect green certificate and balancing market revenues
